## Getting Started

There are altogether 4 packages in the project. To quickly start the project, go directly to the Test package and run each Test.

- Arc : This package contains the different Arc classes for PetriNetwork  
- Exception4PetriNetwork : This package contains exception classes in PetriNetwork  
- PetriNetwork : The package contains the main PetriNetwork classes, such as Place, Transition, PetriNetwork, and PetriNetworkImpl

##  Link between code and design pattern

Overall, the code and design are basically consistent. The method we added later was mainly used to break up a large function into smaller functions and implement them in their own classes. In PetriNetwork we added some methods to refine the functionality, such as the addition of different types of Arcs
